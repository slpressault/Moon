> "The point is not to answer all the questions, the point is for you to find peace." - Shaykh Hamdi

<p id="section3">Shaykh Hamdi teaches that we are in dire need to learn, cultivate, and shape a Healthy Muslim Personality. For such a personality is the rock upon which we cast our rope. Without a clear and tangible example of what it means to be a healthy Muslim, the continuity of our Tradition is at a peril. And yet transmitting the healthy personality requires a healthy culture. When there is a cultural vacuum, religion begins to depend upon doctrines, texts and letters. In an unhealthy culture, the Letter is the omnibus aut nihil to understanding. A healthy culture, on the other hand, transforms people through virtuous exemplars. The Letter may be present to support and explain notions, but remains secondary to cultural and character development. As C.S. Lewis writes in the <a href="http://www.samizdat.qc.ca/cosmos/philo/AbolitionofMan.pdf">Abolition of Man</a>, “I had sooner play cards against a man who was quite sceptical about ethics, but bred to believe that ‘a gentleman does not cheat’, than against an irreproachable moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers.” Regardless of one’s theoretical understanding of morality and virtue, a healthy culture is the bedrock of healthy personalities.</p>


Our Example, the Emissary of God, is known as the Illiterate Prophet (an-Nabī al-Ummi)<sup><a href="#section1">1</a></sup>. If we glance at his life, we see that he never  depended on the Letter of the Qu’ran to shape his Noble Personality, nor did he depend upon it to transmit his heritage. Indeed, the Qur’an is revealed to him as the Revered Sacred Letter, but such reverence came through him ﷺ, and not independent from him. The Letter of the Qur'an could not have been foundational in the spiritual education of his Companions. The actual text was always secondary for transmitting the Prophetic Model. In the words of the Shaykh,
> "The Companions were looking into the Prophet ﷺ to understand the Qur'an. They were not reading the Qur'an to understand the Prophet ﷺ. And looking at him was enough in itself because he was the Walking Qur'an."

When the Qur’an was revealed, the Companions of the Beloved Prophet ﷺ embodied the Spirit of the Letter through the Person of the Prophet ﷺ. As his dear wife, our Lady A’isha, said of her husband, “he was the Walking Qur’an.” The Companions relied on the Walking Qur’an to become themselves Walking Qur’ans. They were a generation of enlightened people who lived the virtues, wisdoms and lights of the Sacred Book.


The Prophetic Model was transmitted by examples of Men and Women who exemplified the Healthy Muslim Personality. These were the Saints of our Tradition. Some of these people had formal scholarly training, but most were illiterate. Formal education has never been a criteria for sainthood. Scholars had their place to preserve aspects of the Religion. But people’s hearts opened to God through the embodiment of the Prophetic Way, not through formal education. But whether our Ancestors were scholars or not, they held an Illiterate Mindset that allowed their hearts to open to the God. They were ummiyyin. They did not depend on understanding the Letter to forge their character. Rather they lived the Spirit of the Qur’an through the Walking Inheritors of the Prophetic Way.


Our Ancestors were also shaped by a culture that revered the Symbols of God. Often towns would only have a few physical copies of Qur’an, if even. This scarcity deepened their reverence and thus the Qu’ran further reminded people of the Beauty and Majesty of God.


Our Ancestors lived in a healthy culture that provided a framework in which people could thrive as they sought their Lord. Most of our grandparents, who were not scholars, memorized only a few Sacred Verses of the Qur’an and yet were so Saintly. They revered the Scripture because they saw the living examples of the Prophetic Way doing the same. The Prophetic Model did not depend upon the Letter. Literacy did not make or break the ability of our Ancestors to live a Healthy Muslim Personality. Their sainthood (wilaya) did not depend upon their ability to read. In fact, many of our Saints weren’t even Arabophones. Their deep reverence for the Sacred helped shape a culture that shared and transmitted virtue and morality. They had a proper upbringing. Their culture was flowing with the Unseen, yet tangible Barakah of the Qur’an.  But their personality did not depend upon the text. Even if no one knew how to read the Qu’ran, or has memorized the text, their personality would have remained unchanged.


A heritage is shaped when there is continuity between generations. The continuity of our heritage was preserved because our Ancestors were forged through the Illiterate Mindset. One generation would treat the Elders of their community, whether Scholar or not, as their link to the Prophetic heritage. Our Ancestors knew intrinsically that one day, they too, would have to transmit the heritage. And thus, legacies didn’t rely on information, but on the educational program whose sole purpose was to transform.

<p id="section4">In contrast, our generation is one of the first generations to depend upon the Letter. In the last decades, there has been a shift in mindset that has posed a great challenge. We now rely upon the Letter in ways that were unknown to our forefathers. Volumes of scholarship are now available at our fingertips. For some, this access to knowledge is progress. But that “progress” has brought about plagues unheard of before our time. Our newly discovered capacity to read the Letter has proven to be a challenge. Many approach the Letter of the Qur’an or of the Hadith seeking to become more informed as they continue their path. But when encountering the text, they are surprised at its content. Some turn away out of a bad reaction, and others embrace it without truly understanding it. This is why there is so much extremism in the world today. Extremists rely heavily on the text as it is<a href="#section2"><sup>2</sup></a>. They quote the Qur’an and the Hadith, and reference our scholars. But their actions go against universal common sense. People are left asking themselves: “how could God command such heinous crimes?”</p>

In one way or another, we have all become slaves to the Letter. Many look back at our Ancestors with pity, especially when it comes to religious matters. Some balk at the cultural practices of our Ancestors thinking that they are merely superstitions, a folklore that ought to be done with. Extremists will go as far as excommunicating their own forefathers because of their newly found ability to read the text. And to their credit, the text often confuses and derails the seeker of God without a proper interpretation. Others look at the Sufi lore and attempt to recreate the asceticism of the great men and women of God. Little do they know of the contexts which these practices developed. Extremists on all sides is a direct consequence of this new condition.

In reality, it takes a true lover of God and of His Prophet ﷺ to drown themselves in the Letter of the Qur’an and Hadith. This is because, as the poet says, the eye of the lover does not see fault in the Beloved. Scholars of old would look at the Text, if they could read and understand it, and out of love, need not justify or explain. But that was for a particular time. Their faith and their love didn’t depend upon a proper explanation. But the eye of the enemy sees the fault. And we live in a atheistic culture that is blind to God and His Prophet ﷺ, may God protect us.


This poses a challenge for our generation. We are now forced to retrace the example of the Illiterate ﷺ through the Letter. Literacy is our challenge but like other challenges throughout our History, it is also an opportunity. We are the generation that has to make the text shape the Healthy Muslim Personality. We need to go word by word, and elucidate its link to the Prophetic heritage. 

Our Ancestors made Islam universal by walking its Spirit. The text was always secondary for them. If and when they read it, every utterance was a reminder of their Beloved. They didn't take a reductionist approach to the Qur'an. Only the Scholars really needed to read the text to clarify a particular point. The text was primarily informative while the Healthy Muslim Personality was transformative. 

> "Our Ancestors were Walking Qur'an with just the Basmala," says Shaykh Hamdi.

The text was processed through their personality, like nectar turning into honey. The hearts of people found peace through them. But in our time, the text needs to speak the language of our context. We need to process it for our context, the way our Illiterate Ancestors did for theirs. To cultivate a Healthy Muslim Personality, our generation needs to approach the text with the transformative mindset of the Illiterate. Only then, will we see with the eye of Love.

<p id="section1"><sup><a href="#section3">1</a></sup> One of the titles of the Prophet ﷺ is 'an-Nabi al-Ummi.' This is often translated as "the Illiterate/unlettered Prophet" but other meanings can also be derived. “Umm” means "Mother." And the Mother is the one who gives us the essential foundational knowledge and understanding that guides us throughout our life. Someone who is “Ummi” is one who has been to the School of the Mother - the original school. That is the meaning of “illiterate.” It is a pure state that forges the Healthy Muslim Personality.

For more on why the Prophet ﷺ was called the Illiterate Prophet, see Shaykh Hamdi’s article on SeekersHub Global: <a href=" http://seekershub.org/blog/2016/04/why-illiterate-prophet/">http://seekershub.org/blog/2016/04/why-illiterate-prophet/</a></p>

<p id="section2"><a href="#section4"><sup>2</sup></a> Extremists groups such as ISIS use the Qur’an, the Hadith, and the saying of the Scholars to justify their crimes. In fact, if we were to only take a textual approach to the religion, their crimes would be fully justified. Some scholars have begun presenting alternative interpretations of the text to counter the ideological extremism of ISIS. However, their attempts are always replied by a counter-argument.

We do not need to look far. If our Ancestors are our guiding North Star, then it becomes obvious, especially those who could read the texts, that they were morally sound. They would teach a Hadith like: “I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that God is God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God…” and yet would hold moral integrity when dealing with non-Muslims. They knew that this Hadith was referring to a particular context and “the people” referred to the Quraysh that were at war with the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. Nevertheless, people did not rely on the interpretation of that Hadith to treat others virtuously. Whether that interpretations was taught or not is irrelevant. They were people who had a Healthy Muslim Personality and therefore were morally sound and virtuous no matter what.</p>
