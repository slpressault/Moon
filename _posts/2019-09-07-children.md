A few days after my daughter was born, I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Girls-Edge-Girls-Sexual-Cyberbubble-Environmental/dp/0465022065">Girls on the Edge</a> by Dr. Leonard Sax. I had heard many parents speaking about Dr. Sax and his important research on gender. As a new father, I knew that I had been thrown into a completely new journey and the idea of raising a woman became a reality.

Dr. Sax’s work was revealing. In the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2019/5/9/18541982/sexual-harassment-me-too-eeoc-complaints"> Me Too Era</a>, no one can deny the challenges that women face in their homes, their communities, and the workplace. We live in a sexualized society. The film and advertising industries have blended into the pornographic industry. We are raising <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content"> children who will face the realities of sexuality</a> way before they reach the emotional and intellectual maturity required to understand its impact. Dr. Sax references two studies by Barbara Fredrickson on sexualization published in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomi-Ann_Roberts/publication/247434408_That_swimsuit_becomes_you_Sex_differences_in_self-objectification_restrained_eating_and_math_performance_Correction_to_Fredrickson_et_al_1998/links/5540fcb30cf2718618dc9672/That-swimsuit-becomes-you-Sex-differences-in-self-objectification-restrained-eating-and-math-performance-Correction-to-Fredrickson-et-al-1998.pdf"> Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1998)</a> and the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2006.00262.x". Psychology of Women Quarterly (2006) </a>. For their studies, Fredrickson and her team “recruited college women and men, then randomly assigned each volunteer to wear either a bulky sweater or a swimsuit. The men wore swim trunks, and the women wore one-piece bathing suits. Each volunteer was sitting in a dressing room: no windows, no observers. Each volunteer was then asked to take a math quiz while sitting in the dressing room. [...] The men who were wearing swim trunks did slightly better than the men who were wearing bulky sweaters. The women who were wearing swimsuits did significantly worse than the women who were wearing bulky sweaters.” (Sax, 2010) Fredrickson described this phenomenon as “self-objectification.” I don’t think this is surprising. Clothes have a profound impact on our personal, emotional, and intellectual development. They can be a source of confidence and self-esteem or of shame and embarrassment. How often do we find ourselves needing to change our clean and ironed trousers because of a coffee spill? Our clothing give us a sense of dignity and self-worth. There are many philanthropic organizations that offer clothing services for <a href="https://careergear.org"> men </a> and <a href="https://dressforsuccess.org"> women </a> to break the cycle of poverty and improve wellbeing.
    
As new parents, my wife and I were in the midst of a never-ending stream of baby clothes. Though well intentioned, the gifts usually came with one particular condition: that our child wears the garment. We didn’t think much of it at first. We had a gamut of baby clothes from dresses, skirts, tunics, jeans, and shorts, to pyjamas, onesies, tights, and hats. Some were pink, some were blue, others were used, and others new. Some were beautiful and others not so much. But the common thread was that they came with that one condition. We were also thinking deeply on how we will raise our daughter even though she barely could open her eyelids to the marvels of the world. We know that our responsibility as parents is to guide her journey to God. Our Teacher, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shaykhhamdi/"> Shaykh Hamdi Ben Aissa </a>, once said: “Raising children is like planting seeds, it begins with intentions.” We wanted to ensure that everything we did for our children was done with that intention. 

One particular pair of pants didn’t sit right with us. We hadn’t done the laundry in a couple of days and the only pair of clean pants available had the word  “Cutie” written right on the back. We dressed our daughter and off we went into the world. Every Saturday evening, my family attends a weekly community potluck and Mawlid at the <a href="https://rhodainstitute.org/"> Rhoda Masjid </a> in the company of Shaykh Hamdi. This is a time for us to deepen our bonds with our community, to gain insight on the spiritual journey, and to cultivate our relationship with God and His Prophet, may God continue to nourish his light, as well as our connection to him. Shaykh Hamdi has an eye for detail. When it comes to clothing, he teaches that what we wear has a profound impact on our personal development. Once, we were in the midst of our night prayers during the Holy Month of Ramadan when a man wearing a t-shirt with the word “Lost” on the chest walked in. Shaykh Hamdi, who was giving a reminder to the congregation, saw the shirt right away and said, “God willing, you are found,” and then followed-up by gifting him a beautiful and angelic white garb. He told us afterwards that the messages on our shirts have an impact on our personality and character. He shared with us that the Prophet ﷺ would encourage his companions to change their names if they held a bad meaning. He taught his disciples to name their children after their pious ancestors. He would also beautify the names of towns as he did when he called Yathrib, Madina al-Munawarrah, the City of Lights. 

While we were having our community potluck, we greeted Shaykh Hamdi.  He embraced our daughter and he noticed the word on her pants. Nodding his head, as if he’d seen this before, he told us that clothes like this aren’t Godly, even for a baby. When we wear our clothes, we need to do so with the intention of seeking God.  Our initial hunch was confirmed and we understood the gravity of children’s clothing. In the Qu’ran, God teaches us the purpose of clothing:

> “O Children of Adam! We have indeed sent down upon you clothing to cover your nakedness, and rich adornment. But the clothing of reverence, that is better. This is among the signs of God, that haply they may remember.” (Al-A'raf, 7:26)

God illustrates three purposes for clothing in the Qur’an: to cover nakedness, to beautify, and to be a sign of God. Clothing is integral to human dignity. It elevates the human being from his or her animal nature, while beautifying and reminding people of God. Shaykh Hamdi reminded us that clothing, even for babies and children, must be in accordance to that purpose.

When we went back home, we did the inventory of all of our daughter’s clothes with this mindset. We approached each piece of clothing as clothing of reverence (libas taqwa). As we rummaged through piles, we begun noticing patterns. Some of the new clothes had undignified words or messages. One shirt with the word “juicy” and another with the phrase “Daddy’s Little Monster.” If the Prophet ﷺ emphasized the power and influence of names for people and places, wouldn’t these messages also have an influence? Once Shaykh Hamdi saw a toddler that was completely out of control. The toddler was running around, throwing objects on the ground, and yelling whenever he would be picked up. Shaykh Hamdi saw that the word “turbulent” was written on his shirt. He suggested to the parents to change the shirt. Immediately the toddler’s behaviour improved. This is not to say that there is necessarily some intangible mystical power at play. We can just use an everyday example. A man who wears a shirt with a skull on it will perceive himself and be perceived by others differently than a man who is wearing a a formal suit and tie. This is the reasoning behind the notion of public decorum. Clothing and their messages are symbols and they are meant to influence their surroundings. Advertising agencies know this quite well. If adults are influenced by fashion, then we cannot deny that children are as well.

Other clothes in our pile were immodest. They were laying the ground for a sexualized childhood and adulthood. We found clothing such as short skirts, tights, or pants and shirts with sexual innuendos. Parents and caregivers constantly encourage one another to watch their screen time, their language, and their bad habits. It’s common sense that young children are sponges, learning at a rate that is unimaginable for us. Often those parents that want to encourage modest clothing in their children are completely oblivious that children are also sponges of fashion. If we want to instil a sense of reverence, we absolutely need to start right away. This is not about censoring our children from the world, but rather about instilling a sense of dignity, self-esteem and self-worth, right away. Our children aren’t our play toys. They are the children of God.

The common thread with all these clothing is that they are new. Looking through our daughter’s wardrobe, we found that the hand-me-downs or the thrift store clothing fulfilled the three purposes mentioned above. They were modest, beautiful, and reverential. None of them had a message written on them. They were classical dresses, plain shirts and pants. By wearing these clothes, we could ensure that our daughter would not be a walking billboard for the latest brand. With all that, the fabric was usually of a much higher quality while the price tag was way lower than new clothes. Even with regards to carbon emissions, buying from thrift-stores is more “green” than purchasing new. 

We live in a disposable society. We dispose of our clothes and our belongings the way we dispose of our bodies and our planet. When we objectify something, we turn that object into an actual thing. Shaykh Hamdi often mentions that the Prophet ﷺ would name his belongings. This created a meaningful relationship between him and his belongings. Shaykh Hamdi encourages us to do the same. Once you name something, it becomes harder to dispose of it. But in our society of abundance, where gratification is easier than restraint, it is no surprise that we objectify ourselves. This is why we place so much importance on the “little things” like clothing. Often, my wife and I are faced with comments that we are too strict, too petty, or that they are “just” kids. But as any parent or caregiver knows, you can’t just turn a switch that imposes moral character. You have to cultivate it within yourself first and foremost, while laying the foundation for others. Our family values public decorum for both men and women. We believe that a sound society is one where everyone presents themselves with dignity and nobility. In fact, this is where we find equality. I want my daughter to see examples of modesty in women and men, so that when she grows up, she knows the value of the clothing of reverence. The Shari’a, or Divine Law, offers all human beings an opportunity to seek God even in the “mundane.” The mundane, such as the clothing we wear, not only has an impact on our personal development but also on our consciousness and on our community.

#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="half">
    </a>
    <a href="/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Alternative way

Another way to achieve the same result is to include `gallery` Liquid template. In this case you
don't have to write any HTML tags – just copy a small block of code, adjust the parameters (see below)
and fill the block with any number of links to images. You can mix relative and external links.

Here is the block you might want to use:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Parameters:

- `caption`: Sets the caption under the gallery (see `figcaption` HTML tag above);
- `cols`: Sets the number of columns of the gallery.
Available values: [1..3].

It will look something like this:

{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}
