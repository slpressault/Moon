<center>Life on the Shoulders is an exploration of a student's path on the shoulders of his Teacher.</center>


## Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes
Who are we if we don't follow what our Elders teach? Our wisdom is simply the accumulation of what has come to pass. But in our time, we have forgotten that we are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants. We think of ourselves as giants.

Since 2012, God has blessed me to be in the company of my beloved Teacher, Shaykh Hamdi Ben Aissa. This website is a humble attempt to show what it's like to live life on the shoulders of giants.

The reader will find paradigm shifting insights on God and God's Prophets, may God continue to nourish their light as well as our connection to them. We hope that the reader finds a deep appreciation and love for the path of Islam and Sufism, and a deeper reverence for Tradition and the Sacred.

God bless you,

Stephane
